## About me

I am a multidisciplinary technologist with a strong focus on understanding systems from end to end.
My work spans cybersecurity, digital forensics, pentesting, networking, programming, artificial intelligence and general IT.

Rather than specializing in a single narrow role, I focus on how systems are built, how they fail, how they are attacked, how incidents are investigated, and how they can be secured and improved.

## Areas of focus

### Cybersecurity & IT
- Security fundamentals and applied security concepts
- Incident analysis and defensive security mindset
- Understanding infrastructure, operating systems and networks as a whole

### Digital Forensics
- Digital evidence analysis and investigation methodology
- Understanding system behavior, artifacts and traces
- Analytical and structured approach to incident reconstruction

### Pentesting & Offensive Security
- Ethical hacking concepts and attack methodology
- Reconnaissance, enumeration and exploitation fundamentals
- Thinking like an attacker to improve defense and architecture

### Networking
- Cisco-based networking (CCNA level and beyond)
- Routing, switching, VLANs, subnetting and network design
- Understanding how networks operate, fail and are attacked

### Programming & Automation
- Python for scripting, automation and security-related tasks
- Understanding code logic, data flow and system interaction
- Using programming as a tool to model and control systems

### Artificial Intelligence
- Interest in AI as a system component, not a black box
- Understanding how AI integrates with security, automation and analysis
- Focus on responsible and practical use of AI in technical systems

## Learning philosophy

I focus on learning by doing:
- Practical labs over memorization
- Documentation over assumptions
- Understanding over tools

Every topic is approached from multiple perspectives: operational, defensive, offensive and analytical.

## Long-term vision

To develop the ability to design, analyze, attack, defend and evolve complex digital systems.
Not limited to a single role, but capable of adapting across cybersecurity, IT, cloud, AI and emerging technologies.
